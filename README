Software for uploading Lattice iCE40 HX1K bitmap files to the Spreedbox PCB via SPI Slave Configuration.

Compile with 'make'.

Usage:
spreedbox-fpga [OPTIONS] bitmap-file
  -d NAME  SPI device (default: /dev/spidev0.0)
  -h       show help

Currently, any SPI device will do since chip-selected is controlled directly by the programmer software.
Note that no other SPI data transfers should happen when the programmer is running (dotstar LEDs and spreedbox-rng).

An example FPGA configuration file is provided in the 'bitmap' directory.
